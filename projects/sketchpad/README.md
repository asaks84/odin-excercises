## ETCH-A-SKETCH (sketchpad)
<br>

    2º exercise
<br>
Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs. Create the divs using JavaScript. Don’t try making them by hand with copy and pasting in your HTML file! It’s best to put your grid squares inside another “container” div (which can go directly in your HTML). 
<br><br>

>(Optional): Instead of just changing the color of a square from black to white (for example), have each pass through with the mouse change it to a completely random RGB value.

<br>
Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so 
that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
